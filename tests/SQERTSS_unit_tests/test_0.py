There are two ways to use UnitTesterSG: either with a known expected response, or simply comparing to a stored response.
This file is an example and template for a case with a known (e.g., analytical or otherwise calculated) expected response.
Just name your file test_N where N is an integer.

#NOTE: FOR THE TEMPLATE AS DISTRIBUTED: WHEN YOU RUN THIS FILE, IT WILL SAY THE **EXPECTED RESULT** MATCHES BUT THAT THE **EXPECTED RESULT STRING** DOES NOT MATCH. IT IS PERFECTLY FINE THAT THE RESULT STRING DOES NOT MATCH. THAT IS A TYPICAL SITUATION AND A FEATURE. IT DOES NOT MEAN THE TEST FAILED.

#This file is an example/template for when we ***know*** what result to expect.
#In the original template example, when we put in the number 4, we expect to get two arrays: One with values  [3,4,5]  and another with [32,64] Note that they are of different lengths. This is not a problem for UnitTesterSG.
#We must make a single results object: we will put lists with those values inside. Recognize that we are expecting array objects, but we can define our analytical result as a list. This is part of why UnitTesterSG was developed, since it compares what is inside, not just the objects.
