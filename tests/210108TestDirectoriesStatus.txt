inside \ini_test\ --> got the tests to work after editing types.py and utils\__init.py . Ini's work. For mini_101.ini, foo.ini, and the ZGB ini, kmcos export followed by benchmark works. 

inside \complex render test\ works now also

inside \test_types\  test_coordinates_list.py  and  test_xml_ini_conversion.py  both run and pass (the 2nd one has 2 tests in it)

inside \MyFirstThrottling\ is a throttling unit test example that works  test_1.py has clear model implemented to remove the old files and then do the export when run. The test takes less than 1 minute. I think it needs to be run manually and not with pytest.

inside \SQERTSS_unit_tests\ are some SQERTSS (throttling) unit tests that work #Dec 3rd 2020: Currently needs kmcos export to be run each time from commnand line first, and/or test_0.py needs to be run first. test_0.py needs to be fixed to remove the old files and then do the export when run. Running pytest in this directory directly fails, but runing tset_11, 12... 19 by themselves pass.

inside \test_acf\  As of April 1st 2021, test_1.py and test_2.py and test_3.py all run and pass using pytest. Stored trajectories are used for comparison. Should work even with different random seeds on different computers. However, to be cautious, occasionally the tests should be run separately, because earlier it was found  that using "pytest" in this directory mysteriously allows all 3 tests to pass even when test_3.py should not have passed. 

inside \test_run\  As of April 1st 2021, test_1.py and test_2.py and test_3.py all run and pass using pytest. Stored trajectories are used for comparison. Should work even with different random seeds on different computers. However, to be cautious, occasionally the tests should be run separately, because earlier it was found  that using "pytest" in this directory mysteriously allows all 3 tests to pass even when test_3.py should not have passed. 

inside \export_test\test_build_run.py runs but test_import_export.py does not run to completion. I have separated test_import_export.py into test_1.py through test_8.py.  Only a small number are passing.  It is possible that some of the failing ones are actually operating correctly, but I have not investigated as that is not a priority. I believe that the case statements are being exported correctly but in a different order, but that may not be the only issue.  Currently, all tests fail if using pytest (some with strange errors like not being able to import kmcos.types). If running them individually, they provide a warning that proclist tests are not working and then continue.

python "test_cli_generation.py" runs and updates the files inside \test_cli_generated_model\   Going inside and typing "kmcos benchmark" does not work. Says no model dimension. However, there is an old xml file in the directory. Pulling the xml 'code' out of the newly generated kmc_settings.py and putting it into a file called test_cli_generated_model_Nov2020.xml shows that there are a few differences (a diff comparison between the two xmls is useful). The most notable of the differences is the lattice_cell_size showing extra zeros in the new xml. (it seems like some kind of some minor error related to parsing or array manipulation or something like that, so is really a minor error somewhere in our code).


inside \accelerated_tests\  added and works on Jan. 8th 2021. May need to run the 3 tests separately and not with pytest.

inside scaling_thermochemistry_tests\ added and works on Jan 11 2021. It is best to clear the terminal screen before running this test. After it finishes, you have to scroll up a bit to see the passing or not print statements. Updated on April 1st 2021 to have more long snapshots at the end for better steady state convergence. This test takes around 5 minutes to run. [Could be made shorter if only test CH4 tof which is first of two TOFs. The second TOF which is water takes more steps to converge.]

#TODO: Make it so all tests run from a single command and pipe to a text file that can be searched for the word "fail"
