"""
There are two ways to use UnitTesterSG: either with a known expected response, or simply comparing to a stored response.
This file is an example and template for a case where we can't simply 'provide' a solution so must compare to an **existing from before** output.

TO USE THIS TEMPLATE/EXAMPLE, YOU MUST RUN THIS FILE ONE TIME TO INITIATE. THE FIRST TIME THIS FILE IS RUN, IT WILL SAY THAT THE CALCULATED RESULT AND EXPECTED RESULT DO NOT MATCH -- THAT IS BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULT DOES NOT YET EXIST. DURING RUNTIME, THE SECOND QUESTION THE PROGRAM ASKS WILL BE IF YOU WANT TO OVERRWRITE OR CREATE EXPECTED RESULTS FILES: CHOOSE "Y"  AFTER DOING SO, THE EXPECTED RESULT HAS BEEN SET.  RUN THIS FILE AGAIN. SINCE YOU ARE RUNNING ON THE SAME COMPUTER, THE RESULT WILL BE THE SAME AND THE TEST WILL PASS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN STORED, SO THE TEST DIRECTORY CAN NOW BE INCLUDED IN A REPOSITORY OR COPIED TO ANOTHER COMPUTER FOR TESTING.

IF YOU WISH TO RESET THE STORED EXPECTED RESULTS TO NOT BEING SET YET, DELETE THE FILES THAT BEGIN WITH THE WORD EXPECTED.

You may copy this file and modify it to make your own test. Just name your file test_N where N is an integer.
