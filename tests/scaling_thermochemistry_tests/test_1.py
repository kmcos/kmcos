"""
There are two ways to use UnitTesterSG: either with a known expected response, or simply comparing to a stored response.
This file is an example and template for a case with a known (e.g., analytical or otherwise calculated) expected response.
Just name your file test_N where N is an integer.

#NOTE: FOR THE TEMPLATE AS DISTRIBUTED: WHEN YOU RUN THIS FILE, IT WILL SAY THE **EXPECTED RESULT** MATCHES BUT THAT THE **EXPECTED RESULT STRING** DOES NOT MATCH. IT IS PERFECTLY FINE THAT THE RESULT STRING DOES NOT MATCH. THAT IS A TYPICAL SITUATION AND A FEATURE. IT DOES NOT MEAN THE TEST FAILED.
