#other common options are:
#sg.simulation_name = os.path.basename(__file__)[:-3] #<--- Uses the runfile name as part of the file names i.e. runfile_TOFs_and_Coverages.csv  . The [:-3] is to remove the ".py" from the end of the filename.
#sg.simulation_name = '%s_%s' %(model_name,random_seed) #<--- Includes the model_name and random seed (e.g., 6483) used for the KMC as part of the file names e.g., MyFirstModel_6483_TOFs_and_Coverages.csv

#If it is desired to run snapshots without writing output to a file, set sg.write_output = 'False'.
#If you want to start writing again, set sg.write_output = 'True' before running
#more snapshots.

#If you need to change a parameter after each snapshot, only do 1 snapshot at a time with n_snapshots=1.

#do_snapshots(500, 2) <-- here is another example of how to use the syntax.

#If you want to dump a configuration between snapshots, you may want to do something
#like this.
#sg.model.dump_config(sg.simulation_name + str(sg.steps_so_far))#


#below are  some examples of  arrays and lists that may be of interest.

#print sg.TOF_data_list
#print sg.occ_data_list

#The final command below writes the simulation details to the logfile
